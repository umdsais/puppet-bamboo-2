## Overview

This is a Puppet module to manage the installation and initial configuration
of [Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo), a continuous integration and build server.

* Manages the download and installation of Bamboo
* Manages some configuration settings, such as Tomcat ports,
  proxy configuration, Java options, and JVM tuning.
* Manages a user, group, and home
* Manages a service for Bamboo

There's still some post-installation steps that will need to be completed manually, such as entering a license and configuring the database.

This is a fork of [maestrodev/bamboo](https://github.com/maestrodev/puppet-bamboo),
which appears to be dormant.  It includes improvements from other authors as
well, notably, [Simon Croomes](https://github.com/croomes/puppet-bamboo).

This module tries to follow conventions in the
[Confluence](https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/confluence),
[Jira](https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/jira), and
[BitBucket](https://forge.puppet.com/thewired/bitbucket) modules

## Prerequisites

* puppet/staging: [http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/staging](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/staging)
* A Java installation (e.g. via [puppetlabs/java](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/java))

Consult the [Atlassian Bamboo documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-documentation-home-289276551.html)
for specific system requirements for your platform and version.  This module
does not manage a Java installation.

__NOTE:__ Since Bamboo 5.10, Atlassian no longer supports JDK < 8

## Usage

### Defaults

To have Puppet install Bamboo with the default parameters, declare the
bamboo class:

```puppet
class { 'bamboo': }
```

The `bamboo` class serves as a single "point of entry" for the module.

### Examples

#### Customizations

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  version      => '6.7.1',
  installdir   => '/opt/bamboo',
  homedir      => '/var/local/bamboo',
  user         => 'bamboo',
  java_home    => '/over/the/rainbow/java',
  download_url => 'https://mirrors.example.com/atlassian/bamboo',
  context_path => 'bamboo',
  umask        => '0022',
  proxy        => {
    scheme    => 'https',
    proxyName => 'bamboo.example.com',
    proxyPort => '443',
  },
}
```

##### Using Hiera

```puppet
contain bamboo
```

```yaml
bamboo::version: '6.7.1'
bamboo::checksum: '774ec0917cccc5b90b7be3df4d661620'
bamboo::installdir: '/opt/bamboo'
bamboo::jvm_xms: '512m'
bamboo::jvm_xmx: '1024m'
bamboo::proxy:
  scheme: 'https'
  proxyName: 'bamboo.intranet.org'
  proxyPort: '443'
bamboo::umask: '0022'
bamboo::download_url: 'https://repo.intranet.org/atlassian'
bamboo::java_home: '/etc/alternatives/java_sdk'
```

#### Context Path

Specifying a `context_path` for instances where Bamboo is being served
from a path (e.g. example.com/bamboo)

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  context_path => 'bamboo',
}
```

This configures the embedded Bamboo Tomcat instance with the context path.

#### Reverse Proxy

For instances where Bamboo is behind a reverse proxy

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  proxy => {
    scheme    => 'https',
    proxyName => 'bamboo.example.com',
    proxyPort => '443',
  },
}
```

This configures the embedded Bamboo Tomcat instance's connector.

The proxy parameter accepts a hash of Tomcat options for configuring the
connector's proxy settings.  Refer to
[Tomcat's documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/proxy-howto.html)
for more information.

#### Installation locations

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  installdir => '/opt/bamboo',
  homedir    => '/opt/local/bamboo',
}
```

#### JVM Tuning

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  java_home    => '/usr/lib/java/custom',
  jvm_xms      => '512m',
  jvm_xmx      => '2048m',
  jvm_permgen  => '512m',
  jvm_opts     => '-Dcustomopt',
}
```

#### Tomcat Tuning

Bamboo's powered by an embedded Tomcat instance, which can be tweaked.

```puppet
class { 'bamboo':
  tomcat_port        => '9090',
  max_threads        => '256',
  min_spare_threads  => '50',
  connection_timeout => '30000',
  accept_count       => '200',
}
```

## Reference

### Class: `bamboo`

#### Parameters


##### `version`

Default: '6.7.1'

The version of Bamboo to download and install.  Should be in a MAJOR.MINOR.PATH
format.

Refer to [https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download)

The file extension of the remote archive.  This is typically `.tar.gz`.
Accepts `.tar.gz` or `.zip`

##### `installdir`

Default: '/usr/local/bamboo'

The base directory for extracting/installing Bamboo to.  Note that it will
decompress _inside_ this directory to a directory such as

##### `jvm_opts`

Default: ''

Any custom options to start the JVM with.

##### `jvm_optional`

Default: ''

From Bamboo's default `setenv.sh`:

    Occasionally Atlassian Support may recommend that you set some specific JVM

systemd is used and this parameter is set to
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/bamboo.service`

##### `service_template`

Default: $bamboo::params::service_template

Template for the init script/service definition.  The module includes an init
script and systemd service configuration, but you can use your own if you'd
like.  This should refer to a Puppet module template. E.g.
`modulename/bamboo.init.erb`

##### `shutdown_wait`

Default: '20'

Seconds to wait for the Bamboo process to stop. (e.g. service bamboo stop will
wait this interval before attempting to kill the process and returning).

##### `facts_ensure`

Default: 'present'

Defaults to `/etc/sysconfig/bamboo` on Red Hat family systems.
Defaults to `/etc/default/bamboo` on Debian family systems.

##### `initconfig_content`

Default: '' (empty)

If `initconfig_manage => true`, this string should be the content to populate
the init config file with.

##### `umask`

Default: `undef` (will use Bamboo's default)

Specifies a UMASK to run Bamboo with.

### Other Classes

The following classes are called from the base class.  You shouldn't need to
declare these directly.

* [bamboo::install](manifests/install.pp)
* [bamboo::configure](manifests/configure.pp)
* [bamboo::service](manifests/service.pp)

## Limitations

### Tested Platforms

* EL 6
* EL 7
* Debian 8
* Debian 9
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Puppet 4.x
* Puppet 5.x
* Puppet 6.x

### Bamboo Configuration

This module does not manage the initial setup of Bamboo - the steps that are
done via the web interface once installed and running.  This doesn't _appear_
to be easily managed automatically.  This includes database configuration and
the license.  Ultimately, this configuration is placed in
`${homedir}/bamboo-cfg.xml`.  Contributions are welcome to help manage this.

## Development and Contributing

Please feel free to raise any issues here for bug fixes and feature requests.
